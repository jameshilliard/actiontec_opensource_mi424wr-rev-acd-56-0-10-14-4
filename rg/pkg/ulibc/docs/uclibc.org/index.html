<a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> (aka µClibc/pronounced
yew-see-lib-see) is a C library for developing embedded Linux systems.
It is much smaller than the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</a>,
but nearly all applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with
uClibc. Porting applications from glibc to uClibc typically involves
just recompiling the source code. uClibc even supports shared libraries
and threading.  It currently runs on <a href="http://kernel.org/">standard Linux</a> 
and <a href="http://www.uclinux.org">MMU-less (also known as µClinux)</a>
systems with support for alpha, ARM, i386, i960, h8300, m68k, mips/mipsel, 
PowerPC, SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.
<p>

If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that glibc is
eating up too much space, you should consider using uClibc.  If you are
building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes of storage, than using
glibc may be a better choice...
<p>

uClibc is maintained by 
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">Erik Andersen</a>
and is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
.  This license allows you to make closed source commercial applications using 
uClibc (Please consider sharing some of the money you make ;-).  You do not need 
to give away all your source code just because you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.

<p>

<h3>Mailing List Information</h3>

uClibc has a <a href="/lists/uclibc/">mailing list</a>.<br>
To subscribe, go and visit 
<a href="http://www.uclibc.org/mailman/listinfo/uclibc">this page</a>.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

Before asking questions on the uClibc mailing list,
you might want to take a look at the 
<a href="FAQ.html">list of Frequently Asked Questions</a>
or 
you might want to search the mailing list archives...

<h3>Working Applications List</h3>

    These days, pretty much everything compiles with uClibc.  This
    is a <a href="uClibc-apps.html">list of applications</a> that are known 
    to work just fine with uClibc.  Since most applications work just 
    fine with uClibc, we are especially interested in knowing about any 
    applications that either <em>do not compile</em> or <em>do not work</em> 
    properly with uClibc.  Submissions are welcome!

    <li> <b>30 June 2003, uClibc 0.9.20 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.20.  This is primarily a bug-fix release.  This release remains
    binary compatible with 0.9.18 and 0.9.19, so you don't have to recompile
    everything if you don't really feel like it.
    <p>

    This release has many small improvements.  At this point, most applications
    that compile and work with glibc will also compile and run with uClibc.
    Perl and Python even pass all the tests in their test suites.  
    <p>

    There is currently one notable exception.  Applications with use dlopen()
    to load libraries that themselves depend on other libraries, may have weak
    symbols within those depended-upon libraries resolved incorrectly.  This
    problem is currently being worked on.  Other than that, everything seems to
    be working.  And everything seems to now be working as expected....

    <p>
    As usual, the 
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/Changelog.full">detailed changelog</a>, 
    and <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/uClibc-0.9.19.tar.bz2">source code for this release</a> 
    are available <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/">here</a>.
    <p>
    

    <p>
    <li> <b>30 June March 2003, dev systems updated to uClibc 0.9.20</b>
    <br>

    The uClibc development systems for
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-i386.bz2">i386</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-powerpc.bz2">powerpc</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-arm.bz2">arm</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-mipsel.bz2">mips</a>,
    have been updated to uClibc 0.9.20.  Several problems have been fixed up,
    gcc has been updated to version 3.3, and Perl 5.8.0 is now included.
    <p>

    This is a 150 MB ext2 filesystem that runs natively on the specified
    architecture.  It contains all the development software you need to build
    your own uClibc applications, including bash, coreutils, findutils,
    diffutils, patch, sed, ed, flex, bison, file, gawk, tar, grep gdb, strace,
    make, gcc, g++,  autoconf, automake, ncurses, zlib, openssl, openssh perl, 
    and more.   And of course, everything is dynamically linked against uClibc.  By
    using a uClibc only system, you can avoid all the painful
    cross-configuration problems that have made using uClibc somewhat painful
    in the past.  If you want to quickly get started with testing or using
    uClibc you should give these images a try.  You can loop mount and then
    chroot into them, you can boot into them using user-mode Linux, and you can
    even 'dd' them to a spare partition and use resize2fs to make them fill the
    drive.  Whatever works for you.

    <p> If you would like to build your own custom uClibc system, you can
	use <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/">buildroot</a>, which is
	how the uClibc development systems were created.
    <p>

    <br>

    The uClibc development systems for
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-i386.bz2">i386</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-powerpc.bz2">powerpc</a>,

    and now for the first time
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-mipsel.bz2">mips</a>,
    have been updated to uClibc 0.9.19.  Several smaller problems
    have also been fixed up.

    <p>

    Have Fun.

    <li> <b>3 March 2003, uClibc 0.9.19 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.19.  This is once again primarily a bug-fix release.  Several
    critical problems with system calls were fixed, the pthreads library was
    improved, debugging of applications using uClibc's pthreads library is
    now possible (requires gdb 5.3 or newer that is compiled using uClibc),
    and a number of other random fixes are included.  This release retains
    binary compatibility with uClibc 0.9.18 (except for mips, which didn't
    work properly with uClibc 0.9.18 anyways).  Updated development system
    images compiled with uClibc 0.9.19 will be released shortly.

    <p>
    As usual, the
