    What platforms does uClibc run on?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    Currently uClibc runs on alpha, ARM, i386, i960, h8300, m68k, mips/mipsel,
    PowerPC, SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.

<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#ccccc0" ALIGN=left>
    <B>
    Why is it called uClibc?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    The letter 'u' is short for µ (the greek letter "mu").  µ is commonly used
    as the abbreviation for the word "micro".  The capital "C" is short for
    "controller".  So the name uClibc is sortof an abbreviation for "the
    microcontroller C library".  For simplicity, uClibc is pronounced
    "yew-see-lib-see".  
    <p>
    The name is partly historical, since uClibc was originally
    created to support <a href="http://www.uclinux.org">µClinux</a>, a port of
    Linux for MMU-less microcontrollers such as the Dragonball, Coldfire, and
    ARM7TDMI.  These days, uClibc also works just fine on normal Linux systems
    (such as i386, ARM, and PowerPC), but we couldn't think of a better name.

<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#ccccc0" ALIGN=left>
    <B>
    Why are you doing this?  What's wrong with glibc?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    Initially, the project began since the GNU C library lacks support for
    MMU-less systems, and because glibc is very large.  The GNU C library is
    designed with a very different set of goals then uClibc.  The GNU C library
    is a great piece of software, make no mistake.  It is compliant with just
    about every standard ever created, and runs on just about every operating
    system and architecture -- no small task!  But there is a price to be paid
    for that.  It is quite a large library, and keeps getting larger with each
    release.  It does not even pretend to target embedded systems.  To quote
    from Ulrich Drepper, the maintainer of GNU libc: "...glibc is not the right
    thing for [an embedded OS]. It is designed as a native library (as opposed
    to embedded).  Many functions (e.g., printf) contain functionality which is
    not wanted in embedded systems." 24 May 1999



<p>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#ccccc0" ALIGN=left>
    <B>
    So uClibc is smaller then glibc?  Doesn't that mean it completely sucks?
    How could it be smaller and not suck?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    uClibc has been designed from the ground up to be a C library for
    embedded Linux.  We don't need to worry about things like MS-DOS
    support, or BeOS, or AmigaOs any other system.  This lets us cut out
    a lot of complexity and very carefully optimize for Linux.  By very
    careful design, we can also take a few shortcuts.  For example, glibc
    contains an implementation of the wordexp() function, in compliance
    with the Single Unix Specification, version 3.  Well, standards are
    important.  But so is pragmatism.  The wordexp function is huge, yet I
    am not aware of even one Linux application that uses it!  So uClibc
    doesn't provide wordexp().  There are many similar examples.  In other
    cases, uClibc leaves certain features (such as full C99 Math library
    support, IPV6, and RPC support) disabled by default.  Those features
    can be enabled for people that need them, but are otherwise disabled to
    save space.

    <p>

    Glibc is a general purpose C library, and so as policy things are optimized
    for speed.  Most of uClibc's routines have been very carefully written to
    optimize them for size instead.

    <p>

    The end result is a C library that will compile just about everything you
    throw at it, that looks like glibc to application programs when you
    compile, but is many times smaller.

    <B>
    Why should I use uClibc?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    I don't know if you should use uClibc or not.  It depends on your needs.
    If you are building an embedded Linux system and you are tight on space, then
    using uClibc instead if glibc may be a very good idea.

    If you are trying to build a huge fileserver for your company that will
    have 12 Terabytes of storage, then using glibc may make more sense.  
    Unless, for example, that 12 Terabytes will be Network Attached Storage 
    and you plan to burn Linux into the system's firmware...



<p>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#ccccc0" ALIGN=left>
    <B>
    If I use uClibc, do I have to release all my source code to the world for
    free?  I want to create a closed source commercial application and I want
    to protect my intellectual property.  
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    No, you do not need to give away your source code just because you use
    uClibc and/or run on Linux.  uClibc is licensed under the LGPL, just like
    GNU libc.  Using shared libraries makes complying with the license easy.
    If you are using uClibc as a shared library, then your closed source
    application is 100% legal.  Please consider sharing some of the money you
    make with us!  :-)

    <p>
    
    If you are statically linking your closed source application with
    uClibc, then you must take additional steps to comply with the uClibc
    license.  You may sell your statically linked application as usual, but
    you must also make your application available to your customers as an
    object file which can later be re-linked against updated versions of
    uClibc.  This will (in theory) allow your customers to apply uClibc bug
    fixes to your application.  You do not need to make the application
    object file available to everyone, just to those you gave the fully
    linked application.

    Can I use it on my desktop i386 system?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    Sure!  In fact, this can be very nice during development.  By
    installing uClibc on your development system, you can be sure that
    the code you are working on will actually run when you deploy it
    your target system.



<p>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#ccccc0" ALIGN=left>
    <B>
    Does uClibc support shared libraries?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">
    
    Yes.  uClibc has native shared library support on i386, ARM, mips/mipsel, 
    SH, CRIS, and PowerPC processors.  Other architectures can use shared libraries
    but will need to use the GNU libc shared library loader.
    <p>
    Shared Libraries are not currently supported by uClibc on MMU-less systems.  
    <a href="http://www.snapgear.com/">SnapGear</a> has implemented
    shared library support for MMU-less systems, however, so if you need MMU-less 
    shared library support they may be able to help.


<p>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#ccccc0" ALIGN=left>
    <B>
    How do I compile programs with uClibc?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    The easiest way is to use the compiler wrapper built by uClibc.  Instead of
    using your usual compiler or cross compiler, you can use i386-uclibc-gcc,
    (or whatever is appropriate for your target architecture) and your
    applications will auto-magically link against uClibc.  You can also 
    build your own native uClibc toolchain.  Just download the uClibc toolchain
    builder from 
    <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/toolchain/">uClibc toolchain builder</a>,
    or the uClibc buildroot system from
    <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/">uClibc buildroot system</a>,
    adjust the Makefile settings to match your target system, and then run 'make'.
    <p>
    If you want to be <em>really</em> lazy and start using uClibc right
    away without needing to compile your own toolchain or anything, you can
    grab a copy of the uClibc development systems, currently available for
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-i386.bz2">i386</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-powerpc.bz2">powerpc</a>,
    and
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-arm.bz2">arm</a>.
    These are pre-built uClibc only development systems (created using 
    <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/">buildroot</a>), and provide a 
    really really easy way to get started.  These are about 20 MB bzip2 
    compressed ext2 filesystems containing all the development software you 
    need to build your own uClibc applications.  With bash, awk, make, gcc, g++,
    autoconf, automake, ncurses, zlib, openssl, openssh, gdb, strace, busybox, 
    GNU coreutils, GNU tar, GNU grep, etc, these should have pretty much everything
    you need to get started building your own applications linked against
    uClibc.  You can boot into them, loop mount them, dd them to a spare drive
    and use resize2fs to make them fill a partition...  Whatever works best
    for you.

    Why do I keep getting "sh: can't access tty; job control turned off" errors?
    Why doesn't Control-C work within my shell?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    This isn't really a uClibc question, but I'll answer it here anyways.  Job
    control will be turned off since your shell can not obtain a controlling
    terminal.  This typically happens when you run your shell on /dev/console.
    The kernel will not provide a controlling terminal on the /dev/console
    device.  Your should run your shell on a normal tty such as tty1 or ttyS0
    and everything will work perfectly.  If you <em>REALLY</em> want your shell
    to run on /dev/console, then you can hack your kernel (if you are into that
    sortof thing) by changing drivers/char/tty_io.c to change the lines where
    it sets "noctty = 1;" to instead set it to "0".  I recommend you instead
    run your shell on a real console...


<p>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#ccccc0" ALIGN=left>
    <B>
    How do I make autoconf and automake behave?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    First run
    <pre>export PATH=/usr/i386-linux-uclibc/bin:$PATH</pre>
    (or similar adjusted for your target architecture) then run you can simply
    run autoconf/automake and it should _just work_.  Unfortunately, a large
    number of configure scripts (such as the one from openssh) try to execute
    test applications using your target C library, even if you are cross-
    compiling.  This is bad, since it will prevent these programs from compiling.
    You need to complain to the authors of these programs and ask them to fix
    their broken configure scripts.

    When I run 'ldd' to get a list of the library dependencies for a uClibc
    binary, ldd segfaults!  What should I do?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    Use the ldd that is built by uClibc, not your system's one.  When your
    system's ldd looks for library dependencies, it actually _runs_ that
    program.  This works fine -- usually.  It generally will not work at all 
    when you have been cross compiling (which is why ldd segfaults).  The ldd
    program created by uClibc is cross platform and doesn't even try to run
    the target program (like your system one does).  So use the uClibc one
    and it will do the right thing, and it won't segfault even when you are
    cross compiling.

    Why does localtime() return times in UTC even when I have my timezone set?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">


    The uClibc time functions get timezone information from the TZ environment
    variable, as described in the Single Unix Specification Version 3.  See
     <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html">
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html</a>
    for details on valid settings of TZ.  For some additional examples, read
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/lists/uclibc/2002-August/006261.html">
    http://www.uclibc.org/lists/uclibc/2002-August/006261.html</a> in the uClibc
    mailing list archive.
    You can store the value of TZ in the file '/etc/TZ' and uClibc will then
    automagically use the specified setting.

    What is the history of uClibc?  Where did it come from?
    </B>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

    The history and origin of uClibc is long and twisty.
    In the beginning, there was <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU libc</a>.  Then, libc4
    (which later became linux libc 5) forked from GNU libc version 1.07.4, with
    additions from 4.4BSD, in order to support Linux.  Later, the <a
    href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~mayday/">Linux-8086 C library</a>, which is part of
    the <a href="http://www.elks.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">elks project</a>, was created,
    which was, apparently, largely written from scratch but also borrowed code from
    libc4, glibc, some Atari library code, with bits and pieces from about 20 other
    places.  Then uClibc forked off from the Linux-8086 C library in order to run
    on <a href="http://www.uclinux.org">µClinux</a>.
    <p>

    I had for some time been despairing over the state of C libraries in Linux.
    GNU libc, the standard, is very poorly suited to embedded systems and
    has been getting bigger with every release.  I spent quite a bit of time looking over the
    available Open Source C libraries that I knew of (listed below), and none of them really
    impressed me.  I felt there was a real vacancy in the embedded Linux ecology.
    The closest library to what I imagined an embedded C library should be was
    uClibc.  But it had a lot of problems too -- not the least of which was that,
    traditionally, uClibc had a complete source tree fork in order to support each
    and every new platform.  This resulted in a big mess of twisty versions, all
    different.  I decided to fix it and the result is what you see here.
    My source tree has now become the official uClibc source tree and it now lives
    on cvs.uclinux.org and www.uclibc.org.

    <p>

    To start with, (with some initial help from <a
    href="http://www.uclinux.org/developers/">D. Jeff Dionne</a>), I
    ported it to run on i386.  I then grafted in the header files from glibc 2.1.3
    and cleaned up the resulting breakage.  This (plus some additional work) has
    made it almost completely independent of kernel headers, a large departure from
    its traditional tightly-coupled-to-the-kernel origins.  I have written and/or
    rewritten a number of things that were missing or broken, and sometimes grafted
    in bits of code from the current glibc and libc5.  I have also built a proper
    platform abstraction layer, so now you can simply edit the file "Config" and
    use that to decide which architecture you will be compiling for, and whether or
    not your target has an MMU, and FPU, etc.  I have also added a test suite,
    which, though incomplete, is a good start.  Several people have helped by
    contributing ports to new architectures, and a lot of work has been done on
    adding support for missing features.

    <p>

    These days, uClibc is being developed and enhanced by Erik Andersen of
    <a href="http://codepoet-consulting.com/">CodePoet Consulting</a> along
    with the rest of the embedded Linux community.
