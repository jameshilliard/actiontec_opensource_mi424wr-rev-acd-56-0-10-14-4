	  This is the processor type of your CPU. This information is used for
	  optimizing purposes.  To build a library that will run on all ARMCPU
	  types (albeit not optimally fast), you can specify "Generic Arm" here.
	  If you pick anything other than "Generic Arm", there is no guarantee 
	  that uClibc will even run on anything other than the selected processor
	  type.

	  Here are the settings recommended for greatest speed:
	  - "Generic Arm" select this if your compiler is already setup to
	    optimize things properly.
	  - "arm7tdmi" an MMU-less ARM core such as those distributed
	    by Atmel, Samsung, and others.
	  - "StrongARM" for Intel's StrongARM cores, such as the
	     StrongARM 110/1100/1110.
	  - "XScale" for Intel's XScale processors 

	  If you don't know what to do, choose "Generic Arm".
