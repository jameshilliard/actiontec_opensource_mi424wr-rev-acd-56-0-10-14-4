Description: A small implementation of the C library
 uClibc is an implementation of the standard C library that is
 much smaller than glibc, which makes it useful for embedded
 systems.  This package includes header files and development
 libraries necessary to compile applications that use uClibc.

 The Debian binary packages for uClibc do not provide the necessary
 components for using uClibc as the primary library on a system,
 as might be done for an embedded system.

Description: A compiler wrapper for uClibc
 This package includes utilities that function as a toolchain for
 compiling with uClibc instead of the native libc.  The utilities
 have names such as powerpc-uclibc-gcc (depending on the architecture),
 and should behave identically to the base utilities, except that
 they use headers and libraries provided in the libuclibc-dev_TARGET_
 package.  Most utilities are symbolic links to the correct underlying
 utility, although gcc and ld are implemented as wrapper binaries that
 call gcc and ld with the necessary arguments and command line options.
