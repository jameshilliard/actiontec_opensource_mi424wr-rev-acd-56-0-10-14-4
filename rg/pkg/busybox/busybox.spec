%Description
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities
you usually find in fileutils, shellutils, findutils, textutils, grep, gzip,
tar, etc.  BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small
or emdedded system.  The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options then
their full featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are provided behave
very much like their GNU counterparts.
