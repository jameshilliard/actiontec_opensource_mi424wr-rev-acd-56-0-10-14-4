# testcases
#
# This file should be filled with test cases to test applets that:
#
#  - can somehow produce output (we can't test sync or sleep)
#  - have a GNU (or other) counterpart
#  - are not interactive (don't require a ^C or anything)
#  - don't require extensive setup or cleanup (a litte setup is fine)
#  - don't have huge and possibly damaging effects (fsck, swapoff)
#
# If possible, a test case should be made that tests each option the applet
# supports. When a new option is added, a new test case should be written for
# it. When somebody reports a bug with a testcase, that testcase should be
# added here as well.
#
# Some other guidelines to follow:
#
#  - please try to keep applets alphabetized, it will make life easier
#  - use the file tester.sh or testcases when you need to do a non-destructive
#    test on a file (i.e. cat, md5sum)
#  - try to make the applet you're testing the first thing on the line (this
#    not always possible)
#  - (???) if you have to create a temporary file, call it TMPFILE
