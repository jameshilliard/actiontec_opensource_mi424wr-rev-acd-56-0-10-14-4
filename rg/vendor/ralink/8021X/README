=================================================================

This is the README file for the 802.1x daemon - rt2500apd, which comes with RT2500 SoftAP driver.
This README explains the relationship between the SoftAP driver and 802.1x daemon.
In addtiion, this will teach you how to use this 802.1x daemon.
For programmers who want to add other interfaces for SoftAP driver or 802.1x daemon,
This README has also mentions below.

I.  Introduction
=================================================================
rt2500apd is an optional user space component for RT2500 SoftAP driver. 
It adds 802.1x Authenticator feature using external RADIUS Authentication
Server(AS).
 

II.  IEEE 802.1X features in rt2500apd
=================================================================
IEEE Std 802.1X-2001 is a standard for port-based network access
control. It introduces a extensible mechanism for authenticating 
and authorizing users.

rt2500apd implements partial IEEE 802.1x features that helps AS authenrizing
Supplicant and in the mean time proves itself a valid Authenticator for AS.
Noticed that Key management state machine is not included in rt2500apd. 
And those key management is included in RT2500 SoftAp driver.

rt2500apd relays the frames between the Supplicant and the AS.
Not until either one timeout or Success or Fail frame
indicated does rt2500apd finish the authentication process.
The port control entity is implemented in SoftAp driver for RT2500.


III.  How to start rt2500apd
=================================================================
1. Manually start rt2500apd, type $rt2500apd


IV.  rt2500apd configuration for IEEE 802.1X
=================================================================
When rt2500apd starts, it reads the configuraion file to derive parameters.
For any changes to make, one need to first edit the configuration file, then
restart rt2500apd. Noted that manually restarting rt2500apd is unnecessary,
because setting SoftAP driver's SSID with command 'iwpriv' will automatically restart rt2500apd.
In a word, edit the configuraion file and then set SoftAp's SSID is all to do to change
any settings related to 802.1x authenticaion.

This common configuraion file is RT2500AP.dat, located in /etc/Wireless/RT2500AP/.
The format of configuraion file is "Paramater = Value". Each line contains one parameter setting.
The following describes how to achieve :

1.) How to configure SoftAp driver?
========================================
Add correct values for AuthMode and EncrypType parameters.
If you edit like this, 
AuthMode=WPA
EncrypType=TKIP
you would like the AP to use WPA with TKIP to encrypt the data packets.

To change SSID, you can type $iwpriv ra0 set SSID=yourssid


2.) How to configure 802.1x daemon?
========================================
4 essential paramters for 802.1x authenticaion are RADIUS_Server,RADIUS_Port,RADIUS_Key,own_ip_addr.
for example,
RADIUS_Server=192.168.2.3
RADIUS_Port=1812
RADIUS_Key=password
own_ip_addr=192.168.1.123
This implies the RADIUS Server' IP is 192.168.2.3. Port 1812 is used for 802.1x authenticaion.
The RADIUS secret between AP(RADIUS client) and RADIUS server is password. AP's IP is 192.168.1.123.
For any changes to make, edit the configuraion file, and set the AP's SSID again to restart rt2500apd.

session_timeout_interval is for 802.1x reauthentication setting.
set zero to disable 802.1x reauthentication service for each session.
session_timeout_interval unit is second and must be larger than 60.
for example,
session_timeout_interval = 120
will reauthenticate each session every 2 minutes.
session_timeout_interval = 0
will disable reauthenticate service.


V.  How to add other interfaces to this SoftAp driver and 802.1x daemon?
=================================================================
For programmers who want to add interface for 802.1x daemon and SoftAp driver,
edit the configuration file and reset SoftAP's SSID via linux IOCTL. 
Detailed linux IOCTL informtaion is in the interface.txt come with 802.1x daemon.
Please refer to that.
