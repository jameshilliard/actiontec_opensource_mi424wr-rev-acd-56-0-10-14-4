BUILDING FIRMWARE FOR ACTIONTEC MI424WR Router Versions A,C,D
=============================================================

* How to install MI424WR source code onto Linux workstation
* How to build image file that can be loaded onto a Actiontec MI424WR
* How to upgrade the MI424WR with the new firmware image file.

NOTE: The following procedures are known to work with recent 
versions of Fedora, like versions 10, 11 or 12. Along with the 
Basic Fedora Install you will want to add the Software Developement 
packages that are provided with Fedora. 

The Actiontec MI424WR Rev. A,C,D Source Code, i386-jungo-linux-gnu 
compiler, armv5b-toolchain and jpkg package can be obtained
from the Actiontec support website at http://opensource.actiontec.com.


1. (Download source code, compilers and toolchain (4 files))

    actiontec_opensource_mi424wr-rev-acd-56-0-10-14-4.tgz
    i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    armv5b-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    
2. (Copy or Move the source code to the HOME directory.)

    $ cp actiontec_opensource_mi424wr-rev-acd-56-0-10-14-4.tgz $HOME

3. (Change to the Home directory) 

    $ cd $HOME

4. (Extract the contents of the source code)

    $ tar zxvf actiontec_opensource_mi424wr-rev-acd-56-0-10-14-4.tgz

    IMPORTANT: Extracting the source code creates the directory 
    "opensource-mi424wr-rev-acd-56-0-10-14-4" and the subdirectory 
    "rg". The bulk of the source code resides in "rg". The Makefiles 
    in the distribution expects that Jungo's openrg GCC 3.3.2 based 
    compiler will be located at "/usr/local/openrg". Both the x86 
    (i386-jungo-linux-gnu) and MIPS (armv5b-jungo-linux-gnu) 
    compilers should be installed to the "openrg" directory.

5.  (The following commands assume that the User is still in the 
    Home directory.) 

6.  (Change to Super User for the following commands, requires the 
    root password)

    $ su
    Password: <Enter Root password>

7. (Create the "openrg" directory at "/usr/local")

   # mkdir /usr/local/openrg

8. (Move the compiler, toolchain to the "openrg" directory.)

   # mv i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz /usr/local/openrg
   # mv armv5b-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz /usr/local/openrg

9. (Change to the "openrg" directory)

   # cd /usr/local/openrg

10. (Extract the contents of the i386-jungo-linux-gnu compiler)

   # tar zxvf i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz 
   
11. (Extract the contents of the armv5b-jungo-linux-gnu toolchain)

   # tar zxvf armv5b-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz 

12.(Change to the original Home directory, the place-holder called 
   <account>, represents the name of the account you were using 
   before you changed to Super User, earlier in these directions. 
   If your login is "bobby", then there will be a directory within 
   the Home directory named "bobby", and that is where you will 
   find the "/opensource-mi424wr-rev-acd-56-0-10-14-4/rg" directory. 
   If so, the command would look like this: 
   "cd /home/bobby/opensource-mi424wr-rev-acd-56-0-10-14-4/rg".)

   # cd $HOME/opensource-mi424wr-rev-acd-56-0-10-14-4/rg

13. (The next 4 commands will build the new image.)

   # make config CONFIG_RG_GPL=y DIST=MI424WR LIC=../jpkg_actiontec_gpl.lic 
   
   # make 
   
   # make ramdisk
   
   # make -C os openrg.img

(The New Image file will be in the following location when the build completes.)
 
$HOME/opensource-mi424wr-rev-acd-56-0-10-14-4/rg/build.MI424WR/os/openrg.img



HOW TO UPLOAD THE IMAGE TO THE ROUTER
=====================================

IMPORTANT: In order to load the firmware onto the router, 
the user will need a serial debug board and a TFTP server.

1. Set up the TFTP server, copy the newly created "openrg.img" 
   file from the build to TFTP server folder.

2. Boot up the Router with serial debug cable connected to the PC. 

3. Set PC IP address to 192.168.1.10

4. Press ESC continuously to stop at the bootloader prompt. 
   You will get the following prompt:

   Actiontec Home Router boot> 

5. Load the firmware to the Flash using this command:

   load -u tftp://<TFTP Server IP>/<Image name on TFTP Server>

   (For example: )  
   
        load -u tftp://192.168.1.10/openrg.img

6. Issue 'reboot' command at bootloader prompt. 
   Or, power cycle the router.
